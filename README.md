# Examples of Canonical Second-Order Partial Differential Equations

These MATLAB scripts solve some simple second order PDEs using spectral collocation.

- Diffusion_Equation.m: solves the Parabolic PDE; $u_y - a u_{xx} = 0$
- Laplace_Equation.m: solves the Elliptic PDE; $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$
- Wave_Equation.m: solves the Hyperbolic PDE; $u_{yy} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0$

These examples demonstrate simple canonical second order PDEs and may be modified for more complicated cases. They are intended as demonstrations for a PDEs class so better numerical codes should be used for higher resolution solutions.
