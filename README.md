These MATLAB scripts solve some simple second order PDEs using spectral collocation.

- Diffusion_Equation.m: solves the Parabolic PDE; u_y - a u_xx = 0
- Laplace_Equation.m: solves the Elliptic PDE; u_xx + u_yy = 0
- Wave_Equation.m: solves the Hyperbolic PDE; u_yy - c^2 u_xx = 0

These examples demonstrate simple canonical second order PDEs and may be modified for more complicated cases. They are intended as demonstrations for a PDEs class so better numerical codes should be used for higher resolution solutions.
